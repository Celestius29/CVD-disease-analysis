# CVD-disease-analysis
This repository explores a cardiovascular disease dataset using matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations. Feature importance, ROC AUC curves, classification reports, and confusion matrices are generated to analyze and evaluate model performance.

Key components of the analysis include:

-Data Exploration: Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset through informative visualizations.

-Feature Engineering: Identifying and potentially transforming features to enhance model performance.

-Feature Importance Analysis: Utilizing visualizations to reveal the relative significance of each feature in predicting cardiovascular disease.

-Model Building and Evaluation: Constructing a classification model to predict disease presence and employing various metrics to assess its effectiveness:

 ROC AUC Curves: Evaluating the model's ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased individuals across different classification thresholds.
        
 Classification Reports: Summarizing the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
        
 Confusion Matrices: Providing a visual representation of the model's predictions, highlighting true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

By examining these various aspects, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of cardiovascular disease characteristics and the efficacy of the implemented model in predicting its presence.
